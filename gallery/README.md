2. **Image Size**: Recommended dimensions are 300x200 pixels for project images
3. **File Naming**: Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens (e.g., `my-project.jpg`)
4. **Quality**: Use high-quality images that represent your work well

## How to Add New Projects

1. Add your project image to the appropriate category folder
2. Update the gallery data in `/pages/projects.html`
3. Add a new object to the relevant gallery array with:
   - `name`: Project title
   - `image`: Path to your image (e.g., `../gallery/web-projects/my-project.jpg`)
   - `description`: Brief project description
   - `link`: GitHub or demo link
   - `video`: (optional) Link to project video
